# Unity-game-script
This is the repository for past game scripts for Unity games.

All game scripts are based on C# (C sharp).

CoreLogic.cs and Player.cs were used in a same game. CoreLogic.cs defined rules about how to eliminate elements in the game.

Movement.cs, Vehicle.cs, and Player.cs served for a 2D racing game. Movement.cs read players' key strikes. Vehicle.cs defined how vehicles moved in the game (including collisions). Player.cs worked for player's status and positions in the game.

Store.cs is a script to load elements for building a store page.
