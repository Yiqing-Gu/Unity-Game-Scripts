# Unity Game Scripts

This is the repository for game scripts used in Unity. They are a part of my work in projects when I worked in AE mobile.

All scripts are based on C# (C sharp).

CoreLogic.cs is used in a SameGame (a game based on linking and elimination). It is in charge of all phases from the game start to the game end including all necessary logics like how to eliminate elements in the game.

Movement.cs, Vehicle.cs, and Player.cs serves for a 2D-racing game. Movement.cs reads players' key input. Vehicle.cs defines how vehicles move in the game and how to detect collisions. Player.cs is responsible for player's status and positions in the game.

Store.cs is a script for building a store menu in the game through loading specific elements.
